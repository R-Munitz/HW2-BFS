# Assignment 2
Breadth-first search trasversal of graphs

# Code Overview
This code performs breath first traversal of a graph. If a start and end node is provided, it will return the shortest path between provided nodes. If no path exists, it will return None. If only a start node is provided, a list of nodes in order of traversal will be returned. 
Handles edge cases such as:
* running bfs traversal on an empty graph
* running bfs traversal on an unconnected graph
* running bfs from a start node that does not exist in the graph
* running bfs search for an end node that does not exist in the graph
